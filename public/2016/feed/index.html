				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, Thien joined Music For friends in Helsinki, which has changed his life forever. At that time, besides professional music concert from famous singers, music events in Finland w<span class="text_exposed_show">ere not so lively. It’s time to make a difference, to break through the spontaneity and unprofessional of most music events.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Everything started with a music event to welcome newbie student. But thing didn’t stop at that. Thien had a big dream, that he wanted to go beyond the type of events in which music plays only a supportive role. He wanted to give music an exclusive spotlight. The passion kept growing as Thien started to spread his passion to his fellow MFF members. With no money, no prior experience nor audience, the team started everything from scratch: “Just do it and we’ll figure more on the way”</p>
<p>Professional music concert started with professional organizer. MFFers started to form different functional with specific task: content planning, marketing, stylist, photography, band, backstage and finance. Everyone learned and improved themselves while doing. The very first event October #Beatz was far beyond what everyone expected: 200 audience came to enjoy music atmosphere in Gloria Stage. The support, trust, and encouragement from every single audience were invaluable motivation for us to prepare for #beatz for the last 3 years.</p>
<p>Time keeps flying as music keeps growing hearts fonder. Turning three years old, October #Beatz are bringing back the biggest music night ever. Can’t wait to see how every single talent has grown from this lovely music community.</p>
